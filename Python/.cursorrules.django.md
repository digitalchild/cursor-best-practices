# Django Project

You are an expert in Python, Django, and scalable web application development.

## Key Principles

- Write clear, technical responses with precise Django examples.
- Use Django's built-in features and tools wherever possible to leverage its full capabilities.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability; follow Django's coding style guide (PEP 8 compliance).
- Use descriptive variable and function names; adhere to naming conventions (e.g., lowercase with underscores for functions and variables).
- Structure your project in a modular way using Django apps to promote reusability and separation of concerns.

## Project Structure

  Structure the project files as follows:

  ```plaintext
  my_django_project/
  ├── manage.py               # Django management script
  ├── my_django_project/      # Project settings and URLs
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   ├── settings.py         # Project settings
  │   ├── urls.py             # Project URL declarations
  │   └── wsgi.py             # WSGI entry point
  ├── app_name/               # Django app
  │   ├── migrations/         # Database migrations
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   ├── admin.py            # Admin site configuration
  │   ├── apps.py             # App configuration
  │   ├── models.py           # Data models
  │   ├── tests.py            # Unit tests
  │   ├── views.py            # View functions or classes
  │   └── urls.py             # App-specific URL declarations
  ├── static/                 # Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images)
  ├── templates/              # HTML templates
  ├── requirements.txt        # Python package dependencies
  └── README.md               # Project documentation
  ```

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Django
- Django REST Framework (for API development)
- Celery (for background tasks)
- Redis (for caching and task queues)
- PostgreSQL

## Naming Conventions

- Follow Django naming conventions
- Use lowercase with underscores for functions and variables
- Class names should use CamelCase
- Constants should be uppercase with underscores

## Django/Python Usage

- Use Django's class-based views (CBVs) for more complex views; prefer function-based views (FBVs) for simpler logic.
- Leverage Django's ORM for database interactions; avoid raw SQL queries unless necessary for performance.
- Use Django's built-in user model and authentication framework for user management.
- Utilize Django's form and model form classes for form handling and validation.
- Follow the MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern strictly for clear separation of concerns.
- Use middleware judiciously to handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and caching.

## Error Handling and Validation

- Implement error handling at the view level and use Django's built-in error handling mechanisms.
- Use Django's validation framework to validate form and model data.
- Prefer try-except blocks for handling exceptions in business logic and views.
- Customize error pages (e.g., 404, 500) to improve user experience and provide helpful information.
- Use Django signals to decouple error handling and logging from core business logic.

## Testing

- Use Django's built-in tools for testing (unittest and pytest-django) to ensure code quality and reliability.
- Write unit tests for models, views, and forms.
- Use integration tests for critical workflows.

## Security

- Apply Django's security best practices (e.g., CSRF protection, SQL injection protection, XSS prevention).
- Use Django's built-in tools for testing (unittest and pytest-django) to ensure code quality and reliability.
- Leverage Django's caching framework to optimize performance for frequently accessed data.
- Use Django's middleware for common tasks such as authentication, logging, and security.

## Performance Optimization

- Optimize query performance using Django ORM's select_related and prefetch_related for related object fetching.
- Use Django's cache framework with backend support (e.g., Redis or Memcached) to reduce database load.
- Implement database indexing and query optimization techniques for better performance.
- Use asynchronous views and background tasks (via Celery) for I/O-bound or long-running operations.
- Optimize static file handling with Django's static file management system (e.g., WhiteNoise or CDN integration).

## Git Usage

- Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Follow a consistent branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow).

## Documentation and Comments

- Maintain clear README with setup instructions and requirements.
- Use docstrings for classes, methods, and functions.
- Add inline comments only for complex logic explaining "why" not "what".
- Document API endpoints and data models.

## Development Workflow

- Use virtual environments for dependency management.
- Implement PEP 8 checks.
- Run automated tests.
- Follow semantic versioning.

## CI/CD

- Use GitHub Actions or similar for:
  - Code linting
  - Running tests
  - Automated deployments
  - Security checks
