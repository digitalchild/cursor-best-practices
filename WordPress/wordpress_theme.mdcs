## Project Description

[Project Description]

## Key Principles

- Always write concise and clear code.
- The fewer lines of code the better.
- Follow WordPress Coding Standards (WPCS)
- Use PHP 7.4+ features with type declarations
- Use WordPress hooks (actions and filters) for extending functionality.
- Use namespace-based autoloading (PSR-4)
- Always think about performance and optimization
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.

```

## Tech Stack

- PHP 7.4+
- WordPress 6.0+
- Composer
- npm/Node.js
- TypeScript (for admin/blocks)
- SCSS
- Playwright
- PHPUnit

## Naming Conventions

- Follow WordPress naming conventions
- Use namespaces for PHP classes (PSR-4)
- Class files: PascalCase (e.g., `ThemeName.php`)
- Hook names: lowercase with underscores (`theme_name_action`)
- Function names: CamelCase (e.g., `themeNameAction`)
- Constants: uppercase with underscores (e.g., `THEME_NAME_CONSTANT`)

## Coding Standards

- Follow WordPress PHP Coding Standards (WPCS)
- Use WordPress Code Sniffer (PHPCS) with WordPress-Extra ruleset
- Follow PSR-12 where it doesn't conflict with WPCS
- Key standards include:
  - Use tabs for indentation
  - Space after control structure keywords
  - Space before/after operators
  - No trailing whitespace
  - Line length should be 100 characters or less
  - Always use braces for control structures
  - File names should be descriptive and lowercase
  - Add proper documentation blocks
  - Use meaningful variable names
  - Validate and sanitize all data
  - Escape output appropriately
  - Use WordPress prefix for functions/hooks
  - Follow WordPress security best practices:
    - Use nonces for forms
    - Sanitize inputs (sanitize_*)
    - Escape outputs (esc_*)
    - Use capability checks
    - Implement CSRF protection

## UI / UX Guidelines

- Use WordPress theme styles and patterns
- Implement responsive design
- Use consistent spacing and alignment
- Add clear feedback for user actions
- Use WordPress theme color scheme

## PHP Usage

- Use strict typing where possible
- Implement interfaces for dependency injection
- Use proper PHPDoc blocks for all classes/methods
- Follow WordPress hook patterns
Example:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Class Theme_Setup
 *
 * @package ThemeName
 * @since 1.0.0
 */
namespace ThemeName\Core;

class Theme_Setup {
    /**
     * Initialize the theme setup.
     *
     * @since 1.0.0
     * @return void
     */
    public function init(): void {
        add_action('after_setup_theme', [$this, 'setup']);
    }
}
```

## WordPress Specific

- Utilize features of PHP 7.4+ (e.g., typed properties, arrow functions) where applicable.
- Follow WordPress PHP coding standards throughout the codebase.
- Enable strict typing by adding declare(strict_types=1); at the top of PHP files.
- Leverage core WordPress functions and APIs wherever possible.
- Maintain WordPress theme directory structure and naming conventions.
- Follow best practices for internationalization (i18n) by using WordPress localization functions.
- Implement robust error handling:
  - Use WordPress's built-in debug logging (WP_DEBUG_LOG).
  - Implement custom error handlers if necessary.
  - Apply try-catch blocks for controlled exception handling.
- Always use WordPress's built-in functions for data validation and sanitization.
- Ensure secure form handling by verifying nonces in submissions.
- For database interactions:
  - Use WordPress's $wpdb abstraction layer.
  - Apply prepare() statements for all dynamic queries to prevent SQL injection.
  - Use the dbDelta() function for managing database schema changes.
- Implement proper activation/deactivation hooks
- Use WordPress options API appropriately
- Schedule tasks using WordPress's WP_Cron API for automated workflows.
- Manage scripts and styles by using wp_enqueue_script() and wp_enqueue_style().
  - Use conditional loading for scripts and styles

## State Management

- Use WordPress options API
- Implement proper transients when needed
- Use WordPress metadata APIs appropriately

## Testing

- Use Playwright for E2E testing
- PHPUnit for unit testing
- WP_Mock for WordPress function mocking
- Integration tests for critical workflows

## Security

- Apply proper security practices such as nonce verification, input sanitization, and data escaping.
- Implement proper capability checks
- Use WordPress sanitization functions
- Implement proper nonce verification
- Handle AJAX requests securely

## Git Usage

Commit Message Prefixes:

- "Fixed:" for bug fixes
- "Added:" for new features
- "Perf:" for performance improvements
- "Docs:" for documentation changes
- "Style:" for formatting changes
- "Refactor:" for code refactoring
- "Test:" for adding missing tests
- "Chore:" for maintenance tasks

Rules:

- Use lowercase for commit messages
- Keep the summary line concise
- Include description for non-obvious changes
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

## Documentation and Comments

- Maintain clear README with setup instructions and requirements
- Use PHPDoc blocks for classes, methods, and functions
- Add inline comments only for complex logic explaining "why" not "what"
- Document hooks, filters, and API endpoints
- Keep changelog updated (CHANGELOG.md)
- Follow WordPress coding standards for comment formatting
- Use translation comments for internationalization
- Generate documentation from PHPDoc blocks using wp-documentor or similar tools

## Development Workflow

- Use composer for PHP dependencies
- Use npm for frontend assets
- Implement WPCS checks
- Run automated tests
- Follow semantic versioning

## Build Process
